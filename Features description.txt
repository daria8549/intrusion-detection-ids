Here is a short description of each feature in the dataset:

- srcip: Source IP address (the originating host of the connection).
- sport: Source port number (the port number used by the originating host).
- dstip: Destination IP address (the target host of the connection).
- dsport: Destination port number (the port number used by the target host).
- proto: Protocol used in the communication (e.g., TCP, UDP).
- state: State of the connection (e.g., ESTABLISHED, CLOSED).
- dur: Duration of the connection.
- sbytes: Source bytes sent (number of bytes sent from the source).
- dbytes: Destination bytes received (number of bytes received by the destination).
- sttl: Source TTL (Time to Live) value in the IP header.
- dttl: Destination TTL (Time to Live) value in the IP header.
- sloss: Source packet loss (percentage of lost packets from the source).
- dloss: Destination packet loss (percentage of lost packets to the destination).
- service: Service used in the connection (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
- sload: Source load (rate of source data transmission).
- dload: Destination load (rate of destination data transmission).
- spkts: Source packets (number of packets sent from the source).
- dpkts: Destination packets (number of packets received by the destination).
- swin: Source window size (size of the TCP window for the source).
- dwin: Destination window size (size of the TCP window for the destination).
- stcpb: Source TCP flags (information about the TCP control bits).
- dtcpb: Destination TCP flags (information about the TCP control bits).
- smeansz: Source mean packet size.
- dmeansz: Destination mean packet size.
- trans_depth: Transaction depth (number of transactions initiated by the source).
- res_bdy_len: Response body length (size of the response body).
- sjit: Source jitter (latency variation in source).
- djit: Destination jitter (latency variation in destination).
- stime: Source connection start time.
- ltime: Last packet time.
- sintpkt: Source inter-packet arrival time.
- dintpkt: Destination inter-packet arrival time.
- tcprtt: Round-trip time of TCP packets.
- synack: Time taken for a SYN-ACK response.
- ackdat: Time taken for acknowledgment data.
- is_sm_ips_ports: Indicator if the source and destination IPs and ports are small (binary feature).
- ct_state_ttl: Count of connections with same state and TTL.
- ct_flw_http_mthd: Count of HTTP method flows.
- is_ftp_login: Indicator if the connection is an FTP login.
- ct_ftp_cmd: Count of FTP commands.
- ct_srv_src: Count of connections from the same source server.
- ct_srv_dst: Count of connections to the same destination server.
- ct_dst_ltm: Count of connections to the destination in the last minute.
- ct_src_ltm: Count of connections from the source in the last minute.
- ct_src_dport_ltm: Count of connections from the source to the destination port in the last minute.
- ct_dst_sport_ltm: Count of connections to the destination source port in the last minute.
- ct_dst_src_ltm: Count of connections from the destination source to the destination in the last minute.
- attack_cat: Category of the attack (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R).
- label: Binary label (whether the connection is normal or an attack).
